We are building a web application with a Flaskback end. Use bootstrap styling. 

The data is structured : 
board_games =  [
    {
        "Category": ["Strategy"],
        "BoardGameName": "Settlers of Catan",
        "MinimumPlayers": 3,
        "MaximumPlayers": 4,
        "FirstLED": 1,
        "LastLED": 10
    }]
    
The data is constained like this:
start_led and end_led represents a sequential range. Constrain the set so that there is no overlap between records.
min_players <= max_players
start_led < end_led


The main page will display the data in a table that is dynamically updated client-side. 

A free text field that filters the list by name. 
Filters for categories. Multi select with ANY logic. 
Number of Players is a single integer input. 

Generate a button that sends the list of selected records to the backend. 
Generate separate HTML and JS files.
